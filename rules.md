# X-Team 36 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will first list down all tasks needed to complete and then each person will choose a task they are most comfortable and familiar with. If there are any remaiming tasks, we will discuss as a group and share opinions regarding who will complete the remaining tasks, while taking into account of everyone's workload. 

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks



## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
If a difficulty is encountered, we will communicate about it on facebook messenger and discuss solutions as a team. If needed, we will meet up to help solve the difficulty. When it comes to difficulties in a team setting, honesty and confrontation help ensure that the difficulty is quickly resolved and the team can move on.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed



## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
